## FAQ

#### ðŸ¤” Can I change/remove substitutions?
Yep! Macmoji substituions are ordinary text substituions. You can even create your own from the preference pane. Double click an entry to change it, highlight and hit delete to remove it. To select multiple substituions select one and then while holding shift select another; hit delete to remove.

#### ðŸ’© Why the colon?
Well it's what Slack does *and* it prevents mac os's autocomplete from being too aggressive when you're just trying to type normal sentences like, "ghost bananas are cool."

#### ðŸ˜± You made a mistake!
