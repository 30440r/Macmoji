4. Type something like `:boom:` or `:blackbox:` and hit space after completeing each one. 💥⬛️

## FAQ

#### 🤔 Can I change/remove substitutions?
Yep! Macmoji substituions are ordinary text substituions. You can even create your own from the preference pane. Double click an entry to change it, highlight and hit delete to remove it. To select multiple substituions select one and then while holding shift select another; hit delete to remove.

#### 💩 Why the colon?
Well it's what Slack does *and* it prevents mac os's autocomplete from being too aggressive when you're just trying to type normal sentences like, "ghost bananas are cool." 👻🍌🆒 

#### 😱 I have substituions to add / you made a mistake!
Let me know in the issues *orrr* file a [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)!

#### 🖐🏽 What about skin tones?
Type your skin-tonable emoji, then type `:skin-tone-3:` (any number 1-5) to add the skintone. They should combine!

#### 😫 Macmoji isn't working in Chrome 
Yeah it's bummer. Chrome uses their own text engine and bypasses the system's autocomplete and a few other things, but fun work around is to open Spotlight (cmd + space) type your emojis there, copy, paste, and you're good to go! 👍
